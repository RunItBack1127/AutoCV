			<span class="dp-text">As a[IS_RISING]
			[SCHOOL_YEAR] from North Carolina State University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in the Mathematics disciplines, I am writing to express interest in the </span>
			<span class="bold-dp-text">[JOB_TITLE] </span>
			<span class="dp-text">[JOB_TYPE] position for the
			[JOB_SEASON] of
			[JOB_YEAR]. I believe that my variety of programming expertise, alongside my desire for gaining both team-centered front-end and back-end development experience, would make me an ideal candidate for the opportunity.</span>
		</p>
		
		<div class="line-spacer"></div>
		
		<p class="p-style">
			<span class="dp-text">I possess a strong facility in an array of digital software design and engineering frameworks and applications, notably Solidworks for mechanical design, and various object-oriented programming languages for software design in Java, C, and C++, along with various frontend technologies including HTML and CSS, along with JavaFX for UI development. Working alongside dedicated members of a team, for both coursework and personal purposes, to design and develop functional assemblies of common workplace utilities and interactive games from scratch, while under strict and frequent deadlines, have improved my transitive abilities to cooperate with a team of developers and designers. My capacity for developing alone for personal projects and for coursework would integrate well with a larger team, as I can be expected to fulfill expectations concisely, accurately, and under time constraints without sacrificing quality.</span>
		</p>
		
		<div class="line-spacer"></div>
		
		<p class="p-style">
			<span class="dp-text">Working alongside dedicated individuals has drastically improved my teamwork soft skills and have been key to my understanding of agile software development. Collaborating with two peers to design and deploy an educational computer game for The Freshman Engineering Design Day was my first exposure to understanding the importance of requirements along with implementation in creating software. My individual project-based experience also qualifies me as dedicated and driven under my own stipulations, outlining my ability to conduct myself in an isolated environment if necessary. Implementing and maintaining, designing, and tracking all of the personal subversion, notably merging, reverting, and approving changes, for all of my personal programming projects translates well to a strong and technical understanding of these skills as they would appear within the scope of a team-centric environment.</span>

I look forward to hearing from you to discuss the position further.</span>
